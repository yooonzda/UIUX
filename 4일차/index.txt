A healthy sea
Not only is it a home for more than 700,000 species of life, but it is also essential for the survival of the entire planet. Providing jobs and food for billions of people, the oceans are vital to human health and well-being.

But now the oceans are in greater danger than ever. Marine ecosystems are facing serious threats due to worsening pollution caused by plastic and other toxic substances, destructive fishing practices, and even climate change. However, if we work together, we will be able to save the ocean and protect the countless marine life and people who make their home in the ocean.

SECTION01 (subMain)

PARGRAPH
The use of fossil fuels is accelerating climate change and ocean acidification, putting the oceans at risk. Destructive fishing practices are destroying marine habitats and putting many species at risk of extinction. Scientists say the extinction of marine life in the next century could be the worst since the age of the dinosaurs. But we can stop this crisis. If we act together, we can save the ocean and the creatures living in it from crisis and protect our green planet.
