How to save the ocean in crisis, please support the expansion of marine protected areas!

Please protect the blue sea

Illegal fishing, climate change, and deep sea mining. Our oceans are in crisis.

Currently, there are only less than 2% of marine protected areas on the high seas where all human activities are prohibited! Due to the lack of international laws and regulations to protect the high seas, the ocean is being indiscriminately destroyed and marine life is suffering.

A way to protect the ocean
The UN Global Oceans Treaty, agreed to in March 2023, has laid the legal foundation for protecting the oceans.

More than 60 governments now need to ratify it to make marine protected areas a reality.

To protect the ocean and all life on Earth, we call on the government of the Republic of Korea and the leaders of countries around the world under the UN to establish and implement legal regulations so that 30% of the high seas can be designated as protected areas by 2030.

Greenpeace will continue its campaign to expand marine protected areas on the high seas.
