Help us stop destructive deep sea gas mining.

An inconvenient guest has come to the western sea of ​​Mother Nature, Australia.

Australia's largest fossil fuel company 'Woodside' is blocking whale migration routes and will soon begin fossil fuel exploration.

‘Seismic wave exploration’ is carried out under the sea. It is a very dangerous and destructive expedition, where whales can be injured or lose their hearing.

Greenpeace is putting pressure on the Australian government and companies that are ignoring the suffering of whales and the destruction of the ocean.

To protect whales and the ocean, Greenpeace needs your voices.

For 50 years, Greenpeace has been protecting the oceans, from anti-whaling activities to today's Australia.

Your participation now can help stop gas mining that is destroying the oceans where whales live.
