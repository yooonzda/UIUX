Letâ€™s protect the ocean together now.

Illegal fishing, climate change, and deep sea mining. Our oceans are in crisis.

Currently, there are only less than 2% of marine protected areas on the high seas where all human activities are prohibited! Due to the lack of international laws and regulations to protect the high seas, the ocean is being indiscriminately destroyed and marine life is suffering.

A way to protect the ocean

The UN Global Ocean Treaty signed in March 2023 laid the legal foundation for marine protection, marking the beginning of a new leap forward.

Governments of each country must establish and implement legal regulations so that 30% of the high seas can be designated as protected areas by 2030, and Greenpeace plans to continue its campaign to expand high seas marine protected areas.
