Demand plastic waste-free shopping at large supermarkets

Fruits, vegetables, and side dishes purchased at a large supermarket. When you get home and unpack it, the bin fills up quickly.

The average usage time of disposable plastic is 6 months. But it takes 500 years to rot.

The problem is that we don't have the option to shop without plastic waste.

But what if large supermarkets change? If the supermarket that connects manufacturers and consumers changes, the products on the shelves will change and contribute to consumers' plastic-free lives.
