We need to get away from plastic pollution.

We're working hard to recycle, but why is the Earth suffering from plastic waste?

Because there are no ‘rules’ that apply to ‘everyone’.

The problem is already too serious to reverse plastic pollution through the efforts of just one person or one country.

International laws and rules must ensure that all countries reduce their use and production of plastics to save ourselves and our planet from this serious pollution.

Recognizing the seriousness of the problem, governments from around the world are coming together to discuss the 'International Plastics Convention' to stop plastic pollution.

With your petition,
1. Reduce oil use in the production stage of plastics
2. Impose appropriate responsibility on producers who produce more plastic than necessary
3. Establish a refill and reuse system

Governments of each country can discuss the above issues in depth.
Only by demonstrating our voice and will can we make the journey of the International Plastics Agreement a success. Let's create a clean and safe planet for our children and ourselves!z
