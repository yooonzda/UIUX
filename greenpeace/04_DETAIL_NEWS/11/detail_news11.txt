[Report] My plastic tracker in 2022

Greenpeace conducted a plastic usage survey with citizens in 2022. We develop our own application and introduce the results of more people joining us.

For three consecutive years, Greenpeace has been conducting a plastic usage survey (Pulkok Survey) with citizens to identify major plastic emitting companies and suggest solutions to the problem.

The survey was conducted for a total of 7 days from August 22, 2022 to August 28, 2022, and this year, Greenpeace was able to increase accessibility and convenience for citizens through a smartphone application developed in-house. A total of 3,506 citizens participated in the survey, and citizens were able to easily register the manufacturer, product line, and quantity of the plastic waste they used using the barcode attached to the product through a smartphone application. Additionally, in cases where the material and barcode were not available, additional verification was conducted through Greenpeace's own follow-up investigation.

According to the survey, food packaging materials accounted for an overwhelming portion, accounting for 73.2% (106,316 pieces) of all disposable plastic emissions (total 145,205 pieces). Additionally, in past surveys, the proportion of food packaging materials was 71.5% in 2020 and 78% in 2021, exceeding 70% for three consecutive years.
