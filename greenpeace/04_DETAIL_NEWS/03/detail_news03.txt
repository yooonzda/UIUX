[Report] Marine Protection through Global Ocean Treaties - Roadmap to Achieve 30x30

On September 14, Greenpeace published the report 'Ocean Protection through the Global Ocean Treaty', analyzing the threats currently facing the ocean and designating 30% of the high seas as protected areas by 2030 through the Global Ocean Treaty (30x30 ) presented a political roadmap to achieve this.

In its report, Greenpeace emphasizes that in order to protect the ocean, it is urgent to designate marine protected areas through the entry into force of a global ocean treaty.

This report contains an analysis of fishing activities around the world using data from Global Fishing Watch, and the 2019 Greenpeace report 'A Blueprint for Ocean Protection 30x30 (A Blueprint for Ocean Protection)' includes protected areas. In the waters recommended for designation, the number of hours fishing boats spent fishing in 2022 was 2,938,182 hours, an increase of 22.5% (541,607 hours) compared to 2018. In addition, considering their ecological importance, the Emperor Seamount in the North Pacific, the Sargasso Sea in the North Atlantic, and the South Tasman Sea and Lord Howe Sea in the Southern Hemisphere, located between Australia and New Zealand, were proposed as areas requiring priority designation as marine protected areas.

The report emphasizes the urgency of designating 30% of the world's high seas as marine protected areas by 2030 through the entry into force of the Global Ocean Treaty, and the need for at least 60 countries to ratify and propose marine protected areas for this purpose.
